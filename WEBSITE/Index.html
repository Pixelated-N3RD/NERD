      <h2><em>ABOUT ME</em></h2>
      <p><strong> I Learn, I Build, I Adapt. My vast variety of skills is continuously evolving.</strong> Hi! I'm <strong>Ishan Sorathiya</strong>, a graduate student at
        <strong><em>Cumberland University</em></strong>, currently pursuing my Master's in
        <strong><em>Information Technology Management (ITM)</em></strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied Biological sciences- major in Zoology and minor in Biochemistry and Microbiology, holding a Bachelor of Science in Zoology (Hons.) from The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, India. My academic journey has has taught me alot about biology and technology, where I developed a keen interest in how data and technology can transform healthcare and thats how I studies Bioinformatics also.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my undergraduate studies, I deeply studies and analyzed cancer research through my final year thesis, focusing on identifying Anti-HCC drug candidates using gene expression signatures. This Disseratation sparked my interest in how data and technology can support advancements in health and medicine. I have sucessfully defended and submitted my thesis and I am looking forward to publish my research paper in a reputed journal.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of my Master’s journey, I've worked on several projects—from developing a Unauthorized USB device detection script in Python using the STRIDE framework, and studying the role of big data in pharmaceutical decision-making, where I am learning how healthcare IT can support clinical decisions and improve outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm building this portfolio to share my work, reflect my skills, and connect with others passionate about innovation in healthcare IT.

      <h2><em>ACADEMICS</em></h2>
    <p> My academic journey began in the field of life sciences, where I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Zoology (Hons.) 
      from The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, India. </p>
    <p> I pursued a minor in Biochemistry and Microbiology during this time, which sparked my interest in data-driven computational biological research.  
      My final year thesis focused on identifying Anti-HCC drug candidates using gene expression signatures, which deepened my understanding of the intersection 
      between biology and technology. I have studied many gene expression data and analysed them using various rational bioinformatics tools and techniques.
      I have successfully defended and submitted my thesis and I am looking forward to publish my research paper in a reputed journal.
    </p>
    <p> Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s in Information Technology Management (ITM) at Cumberland University. 
      Through this program, I've developed strong skills in IT systems, project management, and healthcare analytics. 
      I’ve also earned certifications in web development, data analytics, and cybersecurity risk management. The skills I am learning 
      in this program are helping me to build a strong foundation in IT and its applications in healthcare.
    </p>
    <p>The skills I posses are HTML/CSS/JAVA. PYTHON. UI/UX. Research Oriented. Data Analytics. Oncology. Gene expression. Biochemistry. Animal behaviour.</p>

      <h2><em>PROJECTS</em></h2>
    <p>
      One of my key projects focuses on “Big Data and Analytics in Pharmaceuticals,” where I explored how healthcare IT 
      can support clinical decisions and improve outcomes by using big data which is generated from various sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other academic work includes cybersecurity risk assessments using STRIDE, and developing data collection scripts 
      in Python to monitor USB usage on local devices. I have successfully submitted my project work to my professor. Right now I am working on this website portfolio 
      and continuously updating it with my projects and research work.
